# Finiteyfi Uber Dapp
## FiniteYFI(fYFI) is the ERC-20 deflationary Cryptocurrency with the Aiming to Build a new Farming Concept to reward the holders. FiniteYFI is Building a the Decentralized Uber dAPP on the ETHEREUM. As we are writing this we are working on call which is more than 55% completed.
USE CASE:
# 1. D-Ride-Hailing dAPP
Could decentralized ride-sharing apps, with their promise of greater control for drivers and users, topple the incumbent ride-sharing giants like Uber and Lyft?
There’s a huge potential not only for a decentralized ride-sharing app, or a blockchain based company, but a company who can work more ethically for the betterment of this whole ecosystem.
Can blockchain fix ride-sharing?
The ride-sharing industry’s a tempting target for disruptors. Many have sprung up around the world, making bold claims about using decentralized technologies such as blockchain to give drivers and users a greater degree of control.
FiniteYFI is one such app. Built on the ETH blockchain. Like other decentralized ride-sharing projects, it claims to be “giving back the power to the value creators”; its business model is built on taking zero commission from drivers. “We believe when there’s a driver who spends 14 to 16 hours behind the wheel, he deserves to take back all the income to his home,”
It’s a decentralized network that enables riders and drivers to connect directly with each other; drivers can charge what they want, work when they want and build up their own base of repeat customers. Drivers self-organise in peer-to-peer “guilds”, tokenized using the ERC-20 FiniteYFI (fYFI); they keep 100% of fares booked on a peer-to-peer basis, or pay a 10% fee on fares booked through the D-RIDE-HAILING dAPP.
 # 2. Deflationary Token
FiniteYFI is Deflationary Token by 2% on every transaction until 41% the total supply burn.
# 3. Farming
As FiniteYFI is to create reward it’s holders so we come with new revolutionary concept of Farming through Proof of Reward(PoR). The complete and detailed article on Framing will be out after the listing.
Roadmap, Token Details, and Pre-sale details Coming soon.
Stay Tuned!!
Thanks and regards
